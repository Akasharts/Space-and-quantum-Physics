    <h2>Theoretically Time travel is possible.But yet Practically it is impossible.
    Time travel can be done using theory of <u>worm holes.</u>If we enter the heart of blackhole then we can travel to another univerese which may be different in our time line another imaginary world.<br> According to  most famous physicist <b>Albert Einstein</b> who is famous for the equation : E=mcÂ² , time exist in fourth dimension which we cannot visualise.He also stated that <i> Time is just an illusion</i>.As we all know there is another way for time travel, if we travel with the speed of time then we can travel to future according to the equation d=v/t. But we don't have much improved technology such that we can build a space craft in which human can safely travel with speed of light. Just imagine how will a human can survive if he travles with speed of light which can complete almost 10 rounds of earth in 1s! If time machine is made in the future then there must be a time police as TVA(Time Variant Authority) as depicted in Loki webseries.If we talk about time travel on the basis of dimensions higher dimension are capable of timetravel like <a href="God.html">God</a>.There is another theory for time travel. There are cosmic strings in the space ( remnant of bigbang) if  we move arround the strings when they collide we can achieve speed of light.</h2>
